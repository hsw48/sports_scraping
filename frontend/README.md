To run the frontend:
- You will need a mac that contains VS Code and iPhone simulator installed. If this is not the case, please let us know!
- Any node version should be fine. We recommend using the same as the backend: n 18.14.0. If you have a different version of node installed, we recommend using the nvm node package manager to switch versions.
- npm install .
- npx expo start
- Press "i" to launch the app in the simulator using Expo Go. If it is your first time doing this, you may be prompted to install Expo Go. Please proceed with all the installation instructions!
- NOTE: Next you will need to configure the api to connect to the right base URL. Please see the instructions under backend on how to run the api!
